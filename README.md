# Basic calculator JavaScript
This is a very naive implementation of a simple calculator in HTML and JavaScript.
There are a few things I would like to change in the future :

- not using the function eval() anymore as it is said on MDN it is not a good idea (safety wise)
- implement a max numeber of characters inside the calculator screen
- implement a more advanced calculator with sqrt, powers...

I am still learning my way through HTML, CSS and JavaScript so if you have any advise I am always ready to listen !

Thanks and have a great learning journey !
